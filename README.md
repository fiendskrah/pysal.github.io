# PySAL's Main Site 

This is the updated source to pysal.org

# Build instructions

This site is built using Hugo, see [Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/) for documentation and details. 

# Local testing 

Clone this repository locally, and cd into it:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/pysal/pysal.github.io
cd pysal.github.io 
```

Install `Hugo` to build the site. You can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Hugo on macOS and Linux.

```
brew install hugo
```

If you work with a different operating system please see the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for additional installing instructions. 

Run the following commands on your terminal to verify that Hugo runs correctly:

Show Hugo's location:
```
which hugo
/usr/local/bin/hugo
```
Verify it runs correctly:
```
hugo version
```
You should see something similar to this:
```
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.13 BuildDate: 2020-10-23T21:34:47-05:00
```
Now you can have Hugo build the website:

```
hugo server -D
```
Open your browser to `localhost:1313/`

Hugo is a fast site generator and will rebuild pages almost instantly. Depending on your text editor, you may have to manually save the file(s) you are working on to see the changes made to the website. 

To stop the server simply press `Ctrl` - `C` in your terminal. 

# Site Structure

Hugo uses the following [directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/) to organize content:

```
.
├── archetypes
├── config.toml
├── content
├── data
├── layouts
├── static
└── themes
```
The PySAL wesbite structure emulates this directory structure. 

# How it works

We have set up the website so that Hugo will automatically use the html files located in `layouts/partials` to render markdown files under the `content` folder. Unless the format/appereance needs to be changed, the files under `layouts` should be kept the same. 

The magic will happen once new files are added to the appropiate `content` folder which includes all of the files needed to render the site.

Hugo will automatically look for front matter in each of the `markdown` files under the `content` directory and render the content using the structure of an html file under the `layouts/partials` directory.

## For example:
Hugo uses lines 263-286 in `layouts/partials/news.html` to loop over the content in `content/news` and render pages where `type: news` on the news page of pysal.org

# Making updates to pysal.org

## News
Add another markdown file with the following format to the `content/news/` directory. Be sure to include the three dashes for YAML.
```
---
title: "esda 2.0.0"
date: 2018-08-25
month: "08.25"
year: "2018"
rls: "08.25.2018"
description: "esda 2.0.0 released" 
type: "news"
url: "pypi.org/project/esda/2.0.0/"
---
```

## Team
to update the team page with a new team member, add another markdown file to the `content/team/` directory and fill in the information contained in the front matter in the following format:
```
---
type: "people" <!-- type wiill always equal people -->
title: "Levi Wolf" <!-- full name here -->
avatar: ""<!-- link to a user's image -->
affiliation: "University of Bristol" <!-- developer's affiliation -->
ghname: "ljwolf" <!-- Github username here -->
dev: "core" <!-- options are 'core' and 'alumni'-->
---
```
 Use `lastname.md` for the file naming convention

 
## Subpackages
If a new PySAL release contains a new subpackage, you will want to update the website with a new subpackage page. To do this, add another markdown file to the `content/"package"`  directory (replacing the "package" with the appropiate directory) and fill in the information contained in the front matter in the following format:

```
---
title: "esda" <!--name of the subpack-->
type : "explore" <!-- name of package that the submodule belongs to-->
image: "/esda.png" <!--path to image-->
description: "Esda implements methods for the analysis of both global (map-wide) and local (focal) spatial autocorrelation, for both continuous and binary data. In addition, the package increasingly offers cutting-edge statistics about boundary strength and measures of aggregation error in statistical analyses." <!-- description of package-->
link: "https://pysal.org/esda/index.html" <!--url to landing page of the submodule-->
